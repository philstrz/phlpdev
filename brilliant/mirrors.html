      In the first interactive, we have four visible elements: 
      an object in red (filled) and its image (hollow), an observer in black, and a blue line representing a mirror.
      <br><br>
      By clicking and dragging, try moving the object (red) or observer (black).
      Click on the image (red, hollow) to draw a line-of-sight to the image and to the original object.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the second interactive, we have two mirrors, perpendicular to each other.
      <br><br>
      Once again, try moving the object and observer and clicking on any of the images.
    </p>
    <svg width="800" height="600" id="canvas2"></svg>
    <p>
      In the third interactive, we again have two mirrors, but this time in parallel.
      <br><br>
      Again, try moving the object and observer and clicking on any of the images.
    </p>
    <svg width="800" height="600" id="canvas3"></svg>
    <p>
      What if we combine the two?
    </p>
    <svg width="800" height="600" id="canvas4"></svg>
    <p>
      Finally, what if the mirrors are neither parallel nor perpendicular?
      <br><br>
      This time, in addition to moving the object and observer and drawing lines of sight, try dragging the ends of the mirrors around.
